    <p>As I rolled out of bed, drenched in sweat from the hot, sticky, humid air. As I got ready for the day I began to feel excited because, today was the day we would spend at the beach. Playing and splashing in the water riding the waves, riding our boogie boards. Oh yes today was going to be fun! As I put on my swim suit I smelt the lingering smell of the oceans salty water from the previous time we had gone to the beach. It reminded me of how much fun I had, had and made me even more exited. The whole time we were in the car driving to the beach I couldnâ€™t help but remember how much I loved the ocean, I loved the salty water, the enormous waves, I loved riding the waves with my board or just body surfing them, I loved jumping right over the waves or having them sweep me off my feet and pretend I was flying. </p>
